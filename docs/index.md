# What is GNAWEX?

GNAWEX is an independent third-party marketplace for MouseHunt where users can
exchange items with super|BRIE+ as the main currency. It aims to provide a
streamlined, simple, and automated experience like that of the in-game
marketplace, while providing benefits like circumventing the 10% gold tax, and
centralizing the item & map current prices, price history, and price movements.

The documentation follows [RFC2219](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) for
its use of _must_, _should_, and _may_.

## Why GNAWEX and not `OTHER_PLATFORM`?

GNAWEX provides a more feature-complete experience vs the in-game marketplace,
and a more automated experience vs the forum-like alternatives.

Here's a matrix to provide a high-level comparison among the current platforms:

Platform | Accessible price history | Automated matching | Organized listings | Trade items | Mapping | Can avoid 10% gold tax
