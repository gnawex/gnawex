Tradable items are items that may be traded via the _Send Supplies_ option in a MouseHunt profile, or items that may be sold in the in-game marketplace. These are the kind of items that may be exchanged on GNAWEX using SuperBRIE+ (SB+/SB). Any item can be purchased with SB _except_ for SB. Meaning, one cannot exchange SB for itself.

GNAWEX has to have the ff data for its items:
- Name
- Description
- Image
- MH Wiki link

> [!INFO] What about maps?
> Maps have to be handled separately since these aren't traded normally. There are also different ways of exchanging maps that do not fit well with the _Tradable Items_ mental model.
