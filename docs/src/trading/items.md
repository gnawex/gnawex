# Items

Items refer to any item that can be sent with MouseHunt's *Send supplies* option.

Creating *any* listing for items require the following information:

- Item - Item being asked/bid
- Amount - The quantity you want to bid/ask for
- Price - The price per batch
- Batch - The smallest amount of items allowed to be transacted
- Type - Ask/Bid

> **Note:** In the following examples, these prices are just hypothetical and do
> not reflect the actual market value.

## Example 1

You're looking to sell 100x Enerchi charms, and for 1 Enerchi it costs half of
an SB+.

- Item - Enerchi charm
- Amount - 100
- Price - 1 SB+
- Batch - 2
- Type - Ask

So batches are needed for scenarios where items are priced <1 SB+ each. With
batching, you can sell 2 Enerchi charms for 1 SB+, or 1 SB+ for 1 batch of 2
Enerchi charms.

## Example 2

If it so happened that you're selling an item for a nice whole number, then this
becomes simple.

- Item - Timesplit Rune
- Amount - 5
- Price - 200 SB+
- Batch - 1
- Type - Ask

You're selling 5 TSRs, each worth 200 SB+!
